  "prompt": "Fix the JSONField custom encoder support to properly handle nested objects with custom __json__ methods. The issue occurs when a model has a JSONField containing objects that implement custom JSON serialization - the encoder should recursively apply custom serialization rules while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing Django model serialization."
