## Architecture Notes

The mobile app is designed as a companion to the desktop application, not a replacement. It focuses on:

- **Monitoring**: Check session status and progress
- **Quick Actions**: Start new sessions, continue conversations
- **Review**: Examine diffs, metrics, and history
- **Mobility**: Access from anywhere with internet connection

For complex development tasks, the desktop application remains the primary interface.
