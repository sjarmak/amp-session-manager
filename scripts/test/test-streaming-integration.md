# Streaming Metrics Integration Test Results

## Implementation Summary

I have successfully updated the metrics collection system to utilize streaming JSON data from the enhanced AmpAdapter. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. Enhanced MetricsEventBus (`packages/core/src/metrics/event-bus.ts`)

**New Event Types Added:**
- `StreamingTokenUsageEvent` - Real-time token usage updates
- `StreamingToolStartEvent` - When tools begin execution  
- `StreamingToolFinishEvent` - When tools complete execution

**New Methods:**
- `publishStreamingTokenUsage()` - Publish real-time token events
- `publishStreamingToolStart()` - Publish tool start events
- `publishStreamingToolFinish()` - Publish tool completion events
- `connectToAmpAdapter()` - **Key integration method** that:
  - Listens to AmpAdapter's 'streaming-event' emissions
  - Automatically converts streaming events to metrics events
  - Returns cleanup function to disconnect listeners

### 2. Enhanced NDJSONMetricsSink (`packages/core/src/metrics/sinks/ndjson-sink.ts`)

**Real-time Processing Features:**
- `enableRealtimeBuffering` - Buffers high-frequency events for efficient writing
- `bufferFlushIntervalMs` - Configurable flush interval (default 1000ms)
- Real-time aggregation of streaming data in memory
- `getRealtimeSessionMetrics()` - Access live metrics during execution

**Streaming Event Processing:**
- Aggregates token usage across multiple streaming events
- Tracks active vs completed tool executions
- Provides success rates and timing analytics
- Buffers high-frequency events to prevent I/O bottlenecks

### 3. Enhanced MetricsAPI (`packages/core/src/metrics/metrics-api.ts`)

**New Real-time Methods:**
- `getSessionProgress()` - Enhanced with real-time metrics
- `getStreamingToolAnalytics()` - Live tool success rates and timing
- `getRealtimeCostBreakdown()` - Live cost calculation with model-specific pricing
- `calculateModelSpecificCost()` - Enhanced pricing for different models

**Real-time Data:**
- Token generation rates
- Active tool execution tracking
- Cost accrual during execution
- Model-specific cost breakdowns

### 4. WorktreeManager Integration (`packages/core/src/worktree.ts`)

**Streaming Integration:**
- NDJSON sink configured with streaming options enabled
- AmpAdapter connected to metrics bus during iteration execution
- Automatic cleanup of streaming connections
- Real-time metrics collection during Amp execution

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **Real-time Token Tracking** - Streams token usage as it happens
✅ **Live Tool Analytics** - Success rates, timing, active tool count
✅ **Cost Calculation** - Real-time cost accrual with model-specific pricing
✅ **Event Buffering** - Efficient handling of high-frequency streaming events
✅ **Session Metrics** - Real-time session progress and status
✅ **Clean Integration** - Non-disruptive connection to existing AmpAdapter
✅ **Auto Cleanup** - Proper listener cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## Integration Points

The system integrates at these key points:

1. **AmpAdapter Streaming Events** → **MetricsEventBus** 
   - `amp.ts` emits 'streaming-event' with structured data
   - `event-bus.ts` converts these to metric events

2. **MetricsEventBus** → **NDJSONMetricsSink**
   - Real-time aggregation and buffering
   - Efficient write patterns for streaming data

3. **WorktreeManager** → **Session Execution**
   - Connects streaming during iteration
   - Provides real-time feedback during execution

4. **MetricsAPI** → **Real-time Queries**
   - Live dashboard data
   - Cost monitoring during execution

## Technical Benefits

- **Low Latency**: Events processed as they occur
- **Efficient I/O**: Buffered writes prevent performance impact
- **Memory Safe**: Automatic cleanup prevents listener leaks  
- **Cost Aware**: Real-time cost tracking prevents budget overruns
- **Tool Insights**: Live success rates and performance metrics
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing functionality preserved

## Usage Example

```typescript
// During iteration execution in WorktreeManager:
const cleanupStreamingMetrics = this.metricsEventBus.connectToAmpAdapter(
  this.ampAdapter, 
  sessionId, 
  iterationId
);

try {
  const result = await this.ampAdapter.runIteration(...);
  // Streaming events automatically collected
} finally {
  cleanupStreamingMetrics(); // Always cleanup
}
```

The implementation provides comprehensive real-time metrics collection while maintaining performance and reliability.
